This document summarizes the troubleshooting process for configuring nvim-tex to compile LaTeX files seamlessly.

### The Problem

The user was experiencing errors when trying to compile LaTeX files with nvim-tex. The primary issues were:

- `latexmk` was not found, which is the default compiler for nvim-tex.
- The nvim-tex configuration was explicitly set to use `latexmk`, causing errors when it was not available.
- The configuration was also using a deprecated `quickfix` method, which was causing additional errors.

### The Troubleshooting Process

1. **Initial Diagnosis:** We first attempted to compile the user's `document.tex` file using `latexmk`. This failed, confirming that `latexmk` was not installed.

2. **Exploring Alternatives:** We then tried to compile the document using `pdflatex`, which was successful. This indicated that the user had a working LaTeX installation, but that nvim-tex was not configured to use it correctly.

3. **Configuration Analysis:** We then examined the user's Neovim configuration files (`init.lua` and `lua/config/latex.lua`). This revealed that the configuration was explicitly setting the compiler to `latexmk` and using an incorrect `quickfix` method.

### The Solution

To resolve the issue, we made the following changes to the user's `lua/config/latex.lua` file:

1. **Compiler Configuration:** We changed the compiler method from `latexmk` to `generic` and configured it to use `pdflatex` directly. This was done by adding the following lines to the configuration file:

   ```lua
   nvim.g.vimtex_compiler_method = 'generic'
   nvim.g.vimtex_compiler_generic = {
     command = 'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error -synctex=1 %f',
   }
   ```

2. **Quickfix Configuration:** We changed the `quickfix` method from `pplatex` to `latexlog` to resolve the quickfix errors. This was done by changing the following line in the configuration file:

   ```lua
   nvim.g.vimtex_quickfix_method = 'latexlog'
   ```

By making these changes, we were able to configure nvim-tex to use the user's existing `pdflatex` installation, which resolved the compilation errors and allowed for a seamless LaTeX workflow.
